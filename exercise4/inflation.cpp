/*
It is difficult to make a budget that spans several
years because prices are not stable. If your company needs
200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use this yearâ€™s
price as the cost of pencils 2 years from now.
Because of inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today.
Write a program to gauge the expected cost of an
item in a specified number of years. The program asks
for the cost of the item, the number of years from now
that the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation.
The program then outputs the estimated cost of the item
after the specified period. Have the user enter the
inflation rate as a percentage, like 5.6 (percent).
Your program should then convert the percent to a fraction,
like 0.056, and should use a loop to estimate the price
adjusted for inflation
