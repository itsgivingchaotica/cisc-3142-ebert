When persistence is enabled, 
Cloud Firestore caches every document received from the backend for offline access. 
Cloud Firestore sets a default threshold for cache size. 
After exceeding the default, Cloud Firestore periodically attempts to clean up older, 
unused documents. You can configure a different cache size threshold 
or disable the clean-up process completely.
